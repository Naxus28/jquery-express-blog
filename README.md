# Blog

This blog is a SPA built with jquery and sammyjs. The API is built with node-express. 

I used [`passportjs`](http://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication.

To create unit tests for the http layer I used [`mocha`](https://mochajs.org/), [`chai`](http://www.chaijs.com), and [`chai-http`](http://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-http/)


## Main `npm` scripts

`npm start` builds and serves the prod app

`npm run start:dev` builds and serves the dev app

`npm run start:debug` builds and serves the dev app in debug mode

`npm test` runs a single test
